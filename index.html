				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- Have you ever wondered what happens with extra eager developers that poke their nose into everything?
					- Who always provoke and question the management and their decisions?
					- Who ask the questions other team members don't dare to ask?
					- And who are surprisingly sincerely interested in the well being of the company?
					- Apparently, a path often taken is that they stop doing development
					- and they get promoted to management positions.

				<h2>The Peter Principle</h2>

					- The Peter Principle states that people in a structure tend to rise through promotions until they reach their level of incompetence.
					- So in other words, every time you get a promotion, you are in a way are on the edge of being capable of doing your job.

					- Uptil now, you were an expert in your field, and now
					- You will probably wonder "Am I ready for this?"
					- And maybe you are, maybe you are not,
					- but if someone thinks you can do it and if you are conscious enough that you realize the weight of the decision:

					- Do it!
					- You will never feel 100% certain that you'll be able to handle this.
					- If you did, it wouldn't be a on the edge, would it?

					- Being a lead in any way or form is not a new upgraded version of the job you've had before.
					- It's almost entirely new job.
					- You are still within the same bussiness domain, but outside of your safe zone.

					- I'll start this one with a story.
					- When working with one team I struck a deal with management to be a Lead developer and lead a small team of about 6 devs.
					- Original plan was 20% of my time I'll do team management work, while the other 80% dev.
					- It kind of sounded dreamy for me.
					- First month and a half: 4 lines of code.
					- Don't get me wrong. I'm not saying it's a bad thing.
					- But be aware what you are getting yourself into.
					- The bigger the team, the bigger the project, less time you're going to spend actually writting code.

					- First, you can look at it from a purely selfish perspective:

					<!-- - Like right now for instance. Let's face it, talking in front of a group of people is not natural. Please, applaude all the brave people who are going to do it this weekend. -->
					- So at the beggining of the interview my collegue asked the candidate would they like something to drink.
					- I just wanted to shout: "A bucket of water for me, please!"
					- I was worrying not to look like a total tool in front of the candidate.
					- Probably spent more time thinking how clever do I sound instead of how smart is the candidate.

					- But after a while (few interviews unfortunately) I realized:

					- The candidate does, so why not help them with that.
					- I became the good cop.
					- Nodding along with their explanations, saying stupid jokes or even just going "me too" to their stories.
					- I tried to make this formal talk as pleasant and informal as I could.
					- By reducing the pressure I got a more honest face of the candidate and their way of thinking.
					- I have one golden rule that I established few years ago and still hold as the most important one:

			<section data-background-image="media/anna-kaminova-571206-unsplash.jpg">
				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- Don't be an ass.

					- Because it is,
					- I spend a lot of time preparing for the interviews.
					- I have notes with questions, with possible pathways that can lead to other questions.
					- All that to have smooth back-and-forth flow of conversation.

					- You assume that the candidate took some time to prepare, so it's only polite to do the same.

					- And so you hire someone, they are great, and then they are not.

					- I don't even know if there is a way to do it gently.
					- This should be a last resort solution.

					- Make sure that you've exhausted all options before this.
					- Give your team members regular reviews, if necessary give them negative reviews.
					- Maybe they are not aware of their actions and have a strong desire to change.

					- In Europe, we are often more direct and that is not a bad thing.
					- It might happen if you use this three positives approach on a let's say a Croat (because that's where I'm from),
					- the negatives might just fly over their heads
					- and your whole "criticism" of sorts might end up missguided.

					- So: adapt.
					- And this isn't just a culture.
					- People are beautifully different and you have to play the worlds best psycologist
					- and learn to work with hundreads of different personalities.

					- Everyone on your team is there because of a different motivation.
					- Getting to know that motivation can help you guide that person

					- With group meetings,
					- Learn how to lead and moderate them.
					- Know who should be in a meeting and who gains nothing from it.

					- Some time ago, I was just a regular dev in that team,
					- I was in a conference call with my wireless headphones on sitting comfortably in my home office.
					- It was a meeting that took a wrong turn somewhere and now there were 10 of us trapped listening to conversation between just 2 people.
					- First thing I did was subtly turning off the camera and went to make a fresh cup of tea.
					- Then... I started folding laundry.
					- Then I put a new load in the washing machine.
					- Then I did the dishes.
					- I also cleaned out some leftovers from the fridge.
					- Was just starting to look for the vacuum when people started to say goodbye.

					- My general rule of thumb:
					- if you are talking in a meeting for longer than 3 minutes about a topic that only concers a small part of people in the meeting,
					- that should be a separate meeting probably.

					- Capture meeting decisions and share them afterwards as a TLDR; doc.
					- You are creating a paper trail of decisions and action items
					- and giving chance for others in team or even company to see the updates easily.

					- I have a nice bonus suggestion for you I've picked up from a client:
					- start a group meeting with a random question, but totally random.
					- It can span from
					- "which animal describes you today?"
					- to...
					- "what's the weirdest thing in your fridge?"
					- It's an ice breaker, somebody will always say something interesting or funny, and all of the sudden you are all talking and sharing stuff around the same topic.
					- See, out-of-box cohesion!

				<h2>Praise</h2>
				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>

					- Celebrate progress.
					- That doesn't mean you should handle out silly participations trophys,
					- Use the power of compliment only when there is something tangible to compliment.
					- Don't force it.
					- It will start sounding insincere.

					- But also don't focus on only the big accomplishments.
					- People are everyday working on problems that are not on the forefront of you product,
					- but are still important.
					- Small wins that move the product forward are the thing you are looking for here.

			<section data-background-image="media/paul-schafer-787418-unsplash.jpg">
				<h3>Learn</h3>
				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- As with you previous dev role, you need to continue learning new skills.
					- If you got it this far, you were probably good at that, so use those old learning skills to pick up this hot potato.
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section data-background-image="media/lauren-lulu-taylor-692833-unsplash.jpg">
				<h3>Trust</h3>
				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- The same way you need to trust people, people need to trust you.
					- This takes time.
					- It won't happen over night.
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section data-background-image="media/alfred-leung-332441-unsplash.jpg">
				<h3>Protect</h3>
				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- Often you are the one that's protecting the team from "higher forces" and if you are doing a good job of making your team feel safe, you will earn team's trust.
					- So continue asking those questions people don't dare to ask.

			<section data-background-image="media/rawpixel-651335-unsplash.jpg">
				<h3 class="black">Open discussions</h3>
