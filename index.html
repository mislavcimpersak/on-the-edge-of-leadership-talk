					- Have you ever wondered what happens with extra eager developers that poke their nose into everything?
					- Who always provoke and question the management and their decisions?
					- Who ask the questions other team members don't dare to ask?
					- And who are surprisingly sincerely interested in the well being of the company?
					- Apparently, they stop doing development and they get promoted to management positions.
					- (reveal name)
					- Hi! I'm Mislav.
					- Developer / team lead / gun for hire.
					- I'm professionaly in the IT industry for about 10 years.
					- During that period I've went through several companies and even more teams.
					- I came here to talk about team leadership.
					- Position I was proud to hold in several of those teams.

					- And to admit that most of the time I was lost.
					- Most of the time I had no idea what I was doing.

				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- I always try to face my fears.
					- So every time I get a chance to do so, to look fear in the face, I jump in on that.
					- And such was this chance, given to me by the conference organizers, to have this talk.
					- Just one more thing I know nothing about in a long line of me doing the shruggy. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- With zero formal training, relying on my intuition and various random pieces of advice I picked up from people smarter than me
					- I've more or less successfully lead my teams to their goals.
					- On that path, I’ve learned tremendously, improved myself and hopefully, my teams.
					- I've would like to share what worked and what didn’t, my emotions, my regrets, my fails, and my wins.

				<h2 class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">The Peter Principle</h2>

				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- Going to make some segway into roles.
					- For each role probably going to tell a short story.
					- First one being developer.

			<!-- DEVELOPER -->

			<section data-background-image="media/max-nelson-492729-unsplash.jpg">
				<h2 style="color: black; margin-top: -80px;">Developer</h2>

				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- When working with one team I struck a deal with management to be a Lead developer and lead a small team of about 6 devs.
					- Original plan was 20% of my time I'll do team management work, while the other 80% dev.
					- It kind of sounded dreamy for me.
					- First month and a half: 4 lines of code.
					- It was 8 am, a bug report came in, the rest of my team was still asleep and I was soooo happy to actually write something useful and tangible for a change.
					- Be aware what you are getting your self in to.
					- The bigger the team, the bigger the project, less time you're going to spend actually writting code.
					- You need to realise:

				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- You are not a code monkey anymore.
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section data-background-image="media/joel-filipe-166058-unsplash.jpg">
				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- You are the architect, the decision maker, the organizer and more than anything else, the reviewer.
					- You are placed in this position to produce more code than ever, just not by yourself.

					- So if you are not creating this code, who is? This of course leads us to hiring.
				</aside>
			</section>

			<!-- HIRING/INTERVIEWING -->

			<section data-background-image="">
				<h2>Hiring</h2>
				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- For the first interview in which I sat as the interviewer I explicitly asked to be included.
					- Soon, my wish was granted.
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section data-background-image="">
				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- I don't know who sweated more.
					- The developer looking for a job or me.
					- I was worrying not to look like a total tool in front of the candidate.
					- Probably spent more time thinking how clever do I sound instead of how smart is the candidate.
					- In my head it was a mess.
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section data-background-image="">
				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- But after a while (few interviews unfortunately) I realized: I don't need to sound like the smartest person in the room.
					- The candidate does, so why not help them with that.
					- I became the good cop.
					- Nodding along with their explanations, saying stupid jokes or even just going "me too" to their stories.
					- I tried to make this formal talk as pleasant and informal as I could.
					- By reducing the pressure I got a more honest face of the candidate and his way of thinking.

				</aside>

			<section data-background-image="">
				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- I have one golden rule that I established few years ago and still hold as the most important one:
					- Tech can be tough, but I can't teach you not to be ass.
					- (picture of a donkey)
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section data-background-image="">
				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- I'm not very good at reading people.
					- Interviewing for me, but I believe for most of the people, just doesn’t come naturally.
					- It’s a skill that improves with practice.
					- I spend a lot of time preparing for the interviews.
					- I have notes with questions, with possible pathways that can lead to other questions.
					- All that to have smooth back-and-forth flow of conversation.

					- You assume that the candidate took some time to prepare, so it's only polite to do the same.

					- And so you hire someone, they are great, and then they are not.
				</aside>

			<!-- TERMINATION -->

			<section data-background-image="">
				<h2>Termination</h2>
				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- This is the other side of the coin.
					- A lot of people are not talking about it.
					- And that's probably it's the hardest thing to do.
					- Luckily, I only had to do it once.
					- I don't even know if there is a way to do it gently.
					- This should be a last resort solution.
					- Make sure that you've exhausted all options before this.
					- Give your team members regular reviews, if necessary give them negative reviews.
					- After you've pulled the trigger,
					- Ask yourself, was there something I could have done to prevent this?
					- And explain to the folks still on the team why it came to this.
					- Don't wait too long to do it, this is a big thing.
					- Such info needs to come from you.
					- If you wait too long it will come from the other side of that dialogue and you don't want that.

					- Paranoid bonus tip: have a quick way to rotate your security keys. Just in case.
				</aside>
			</section>

			<!-- DELEGATION -->

			<section data-background-image="">
				<h2>Delegation/Team</h2>
				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- You are one, but there are many people in your team.
					- Listen to your teammates, ask them on what do they want to work on, accomodate them if you can, if not, give a clear explanation why.
					- Devs are often quiet;
					- So get to know each team member and their streghts and weekneses and give out tasks accordingly.
					- But work on your 6th sense and move people into new directions.

				</aside>
			</section>

			<section data-background-image="">
				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- Try to read you team's inner dinamics.
					- See who works best with whom.
					- Fortify existing relationships, encourage new ones.
					- That can only benefit them and the company as a whole.
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section data-background-image="">
				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- In extreme situations - you're the one who's only task is triage!
					- No time for discussions, you need to know on a spot who can and will deliver the solution.

						- Don't ping them non-stop, don't throw new logs to the trash fire that is happening.
						- Let them do what they do best:
						- Solve problems.
					</aside>
				</section>

			<section data-background-image="">
				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- For me, either everyday delegation or delegation in emergency creates a really weird feeling.
					- I'm in control, but at the same time I control nothing.
					- I'm responsible, but I don't directly do anything tangible.
					- Success of my job is solely based on the success of my teammates.
					- That can be scary.

			<section data-background-image="">
				<h3>People</h3>
				<h3>are</h3>
				<h3>the worst</h3>
				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- I sometime find myself thinking:
					- "People are the worst" (slide text)
					- Which is a horrible notion if you manage people.
					- Unfortuantely, I kind of have a feeling you all know what I mean by that.
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section data-background-image="">
				<h3>People</h3>
				<h3>are</h3>
				<h3>the best</h3>
				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- But with a good team, a team you trust, another thought comes to mind:
					- "People are the best" (slide text)
					- People love to shine, people love being heros, people want to do work they can be proud of. (superhero image)
					- Just clear the space in front of them, and let them work. (open road image)
					- Just:
					- Trust you team.
				</aside>
			</section>

			<!-- COMMUNICATION -->

			<section data-background-image="">
				<h2>Communication</h2>
				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- And that leads us to communication.
					- For which:
					- you are always available.
					- team is not, and that's ok.
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section data-background-image="">
				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- Have regular 1-on-1s
					- you can have them scheduled or not.
					- in my experience, scheduled works better,
					- it leaves time for team member to prepare.
					- Just don't do it too often of keep it running for too long.
					- And if you want to earn your team members trust, be prepared to open your self.
					- These 1-on-1s work both ways.
					- Be honest.
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section data-background-image="">
				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- With group meetings,
					- Learn how to lead and take control of them.
					- Capture meeting decisions and share them afterwards as a TLDR; doc.
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section data-background-image="">
				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- I have a nice bonus suggestion for you I've picked up from a client:
					- start a group meeting with a random question, but totally random.
					- it can span from
					- which person do you admire?
					- can you tell some random piece of information that you recently learned that surprised you?
					- to...
					- what's the weirdest thing in your fridge?
					- it's an ice breaker, somebody will always say something funny, and all of the sudden you are all talking and sharing stuff around the same topic.
					- See, out-of-box cohesion!

			<section data-background-image="">
				<h3>Learn</h3>
				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- As with you previous dev role, you need to continue learning new skills.
					- If you got it this far, you were probably good at that, so use those old learning skills to pick up this hot potato.
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section data-background-image="">
				<h3>Trust</h3>
				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- The same way you need to trust people, people need to trust you.
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section data-background-image="">
				<h3>Protect</h3>
				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- Often you are the one that's protecting the team from "higher forces" and if you are doing a good job of making your team feel safe, you will earn team's trust.
					- So continue asking those questions people don't dare to ask.
				</aside>

			<section data-background-image="">
				<h3>Set to win</h3>
				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- Prepare the ground for you team.
					- Give them everything they need to succeed.

			<section data-background-image="">
				<h3>Open discussions</h3>
				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- Don't avoid hard conversations and decisions.
					- Be open about them with the team.
					- If you can, democratize decision making.
					- Make everybody feel included.
					- Encourage discussion.
