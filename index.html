						- Have you ever wondered what happens with extra eager developers that poke their nose into everything?
						- Who always provoke and question the management and their decisions?
						- Who ask the questions other team members don't dare to ask?
						- And who are surprisingly sincerely interested in the well being of the company?
						- Apparently, they get promoted to management positions.
						- (reveal name)
						- Hi! I'm Mislav.
						- Developer / devops / team lead / gun for hire.
						- I'm professionaly in the IT industry for about 10 years.
						- During that period I've went through several companies and even more teams.
						- I came here to talk about team leadership.
						- Position I was proud to hold in several of those teams.

						- And to admit that most of the time I was lost. Most of the time I had no idea what I was doing.

						- I always try to face my fears.
						- So every time I get a chance to do so, to look fear in the face, I jump in on that.
						- And such was this chance, given to me by the conference organizers, to have this talk.
						- Just one more thing I know nothing about in a long line of me doing the shruggy. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

						- With zero formal training, relying on my intuition and various random pieces of advice I picked up from people smarter than me
						- I've more or less successfully lead my teams to their goals.
						- On that path, I’ve learned tremendously, improved myself and hopefully, my teams.
						- I've would like to share what worked and what didn’t, my emotions, my regrets, my fails, and my wins.

					<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
						- When working with one team I struck a deal with management to be a Lead developer and lead a small team of about 6 devs.
						- Original plan was 20% of my time I'll do team management work, while the other 80% dev.
						- It kind of sounded dreamy for me.
						- First month and a half: 4 lines of code.
						- It was 8 am, a bug report came in, the rest of my team was still asleep and I was soooo happy to actually write something useful and tangible for a change.
						- Be aware what you are getting your self in to.
						- The bigger the team, the bigger the project, less time you're going to spend actually writting code.
						- You need to realise:
