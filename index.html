				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- Have you ever wondered what happens with extra eager developers that poke their nose into everything?
					- Who always provoke and question the management and their decisions?
					- Who ask the questions other team members don't dare to ask?
					- And who are surprisingly sincerely interested in the well being of the company?
					- Apparently, a path often taken is that they stop doing development
					- and they get promoted to management positions.

					- Hi! I'm Mislav.
					- Developer / team lead / gun for hire.
					- I'm professionaly in the IT industry for about 10 years.
					- During that period I've went through several companies and even more teams.
					- I came here to talk about team leadership.
					- Position I was proud to hold in several of those teams.

					- With zero formal training, relying on my intuition and various random pieces of advice I picked up from people smarter than me
					- I've more or less successfully lead my teams to their goals.
					- On that path, I’ve learned tremendously, improved myself and hopefully, my teams.

				<h2>The Peter Principle</h2>
				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- The Peter Principle states that people in a structure tend to rise through promotions until they reach their level of incompetence.
					- So in other words, every time you get a promotion, you are in a way are on the edge of being capable of doing your job.

					- Uptil now, you were an expert in your field, and now
					- You will probably wonder "Am I ready for this?"
					- And maybe you are, maybe you are not,
					- but if someone thinks you can do it and if you are conscious enough that you realize the weight of the decision:
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section data-background-image="media/sammie-vasquez-549428-unsplash.jpg">
				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- Do it!
					- You will never feel 100% certain that you'll be able to handle this.
					- If you did, it wouldn't be a on the edge, would it?

					- Being a lead in any way or form is not a new upgraded version of the job you've had before.
					- It's almost entirely new job.
					- You are still within the same bussiness domain, but outside of your safe zone.
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section data-background-image="media/hector-j-rivas-772882-unsplash.jpg">
				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- You have to take care of new roles that you are not prepared for.
					- First one is a familiar one, but now it's got a twist.

			<!-- DEVELOPER -->

			<section data-background-image="media/max-nelson-492729-unsplash.jpg">
				<h2 class="black" style="margin-top: -80px;">Developer</h2>

				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- I'll start this one with a story.
					- When working with one team I struck a deal with management to be a Lead developer and lead a small team of about 6 devs.
					- Original plan was 20% of my time I'll do team management work, while the other 80% dev.
					- It kind of sounded dreamy for me.
					- First month and a half: 4 lines of code.
					- Don't get me wrong. I'm not saying it's a bad thing.
					- But be aware what you are getting yourself into.
					- The bigger the team, the bigger the project, less time you're going to spend actually writting code.
					- You need to realise:
				</aside>

			<section data-background-image="media/david-clode-791880-unsplash.jpg">
				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- You are not a code monkey anymore.
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section data-background-image="media/joel-filipe-166058-unsplash.jpg">
				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- You are the architect, the decision maker, the organizer and more than anything else, the reviewer.
					- You are placed in this position to produce more code than ever, just not by yourself.

					- So if you are not creating this code, who is?
					- This of course leads us to hiring.
				</aside>
			</section>

			<!-- HIRING/INTERVIEWING -->

			<section data-background-image="media/daniel-mccullough-514240-unsplash.jpg">
				<h2 style="margin-top: -120px;">Hiring</h2>
				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- For the first interview in which I sat as the interviewer I explicitly asked to be included.
					- What's the worst that can happen, right?
					- Soon, my wish was granted.
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section data-background-image="media/milkovi-352499-unsplash.jpg">
				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- I don't know who sweated more.
					- The developer looking for a job or me.
					- When I'm nervous I drink a lot of water.
					<!-- - Like right now for instance. Let's face it, talking in front of a group of people is not natural. Please, applaude all the brave people who are going to do it this weekend. -->
					- So at the beggining of the interview my collegue asked the candidate would they like something to drink.
					- I just wanted to shout: "A bucket of water for me, please!"
					- I was worrying not to look like a total tool in front of the candidate.
					- Probably spent more time thinking how clever do I sound instead of how smart is the candidate.
					- In my head it was a mess.
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section data-background-image="media/sean-patrick-murphy-551711-unsplash.jpg">
				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- But after a while (few interviews unfortunately) I realized:
					- I don't need to sound like the smartest person in the room.
					- The candidate does, so why not help them with that.
					- I became the good cop.
					- Nodding along with their explanations, saying stupid jokes or even just going "me too" to their stories.
					- I tried to make this formal talk as pleasant and informal as I could.
					- By reducing the pressure I got a more honest face of the candidate and their way of thinking.
					- I have one golden rule that I established few years ago and still hold as the most important one:
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section data-background-image="media/anna-kaminova-571206-unsplash.jpg">
				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- Don't be an ass.
					- Tech can be taught, but I can't teach you what kind of person you should be.

					- I'm not very good at reading people.
					- When it comes to some human interactions sometimes I'm like a deer in head lights.
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section data-background-image="media/vitaliy-anokhin-263154-unsplash.jpg">
				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- Interviewing for me, but I believe for most of the people, just doesn’t come naturally.
					- It’s a skill that improves with practice.
					- But this is trial and error in production.
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section data-background-image="media/alvaro-reyes-735660-unsplash.jpg">
				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- Because it is,
					- I spend a lot of time preparing for the interviews.
					- I have notes with questions, with possible pathways that can lead to other questions.
					- All that to have smooth back-and-forth flow of conversation.

					- You assume that the candidate took some time to prepare, so it's only polite to do the same.

					- And so you hire someone, they are great, and then they are not.
				</aside>
			</section>

			<!-- TERMINATION -->

			<section data-background-image="media/erwin-voortman-564054-unsplash.jpg">
				<h2>Termination</h2>
				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- This is the other side of the coin.
					- A lot of people are not talking about it.
					- And it's probably the hardest thing to do.
					- Luckily, I only had to do it once.

					- I don't even know if there is a way to do it gently.
					- This should be a last resort solution.
					- Make sure that you've exhausted all options before this.

					- Give your team members regular reviews, if necessary give them negative reviews.
					- Maybe they are not aware of their actions and have a strong desire to change.
					- Just make sure you fire a few warning shots in the weeks and months before.
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section data-background-image="media/issam-hammoudi-631683-unsplash.jpg">
				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- After you've pulled the trigger,
					- Explain to the folks still on the team why it came to this.
					- Don't wait too long to do it, this is a big thing.
					- Such info needs to come from you.
					- If you wait too long it will come from the other side of that dialogue and you don't want that.
				</aside>
			</section>

			<!-- DELEGATION -->

			<section data-background-image="media/rawpixel-678089-unsplash.jpg">
				<h2 class="black">Delegation</h2>
				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- You hired some people, hopefully fired none, got some assigned and you have your team.

					- When I first started being a lead I did one thing extremly wrong.
					- I wanted to work on the fun, complex and new stuff myself.
					- It came from a place where I was selfish
					- but also not trustworthy enough.
					- Of course, that backfired.
					- And I became the bottleneck of the project.

					- I had people in my team who maybe wanted to combat this issues themself
					- I didn't given them a chance.
					- Because I was too preoccupied with my work and my problems.
					- The ones I myself delegated to me.
				</aside>

			<section data-background-image="media/kyle-smith-528220-unsplash.jpg">
				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- Listen to your teammates, ask them on what do they want to work on, accomodate them if you can, if not, give a clear explanation why.
					- So get to know each team member and their streghts and weekneses and give out tasks accordingly.
					- But work on your 6th sense and move people into new directions.
				</aside>

			<section data-background-image="media/robert-collins-333411-unsplash.jpg">
				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- Try to read you team's inner dinamics.
					- See who works best with whom.
					- Fortify existing relationships, encourage new ones.
					- That can only benefit them and the company as a whole.

			<section data-background-image="media/jon-tyson-541958-unsplash.jpg">

			<section data-background-image="media/fabrice-villard-769861-unsplash.jpg">
				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- For me, either everyday delegation or delegation in emergency creates a really weird feeling.
					- I'm in control, but at the same time I control nothing.
					- I'm responsible, but I don't directly do anything tangible.
					- Success of my job is solely based on the success of my teammates.
					- That can be scary.
					- I sometimes find myself thinking:
				</aside>

			<section data-background-image="media/ruben-bagues-499746-unsplash.jpg">
				<h3>People</h3>
				<h3>are</h3>
				<h3>the worst</h3>
				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- "People are the worst"
					- Which is a horrible notion if you manage people.

					- But sometimes, it happens.

					- For instance,
					- you have a breach in your production database, a hacker demanding ransom, and the dev working on it decided that it's time for his haircut and just leaves.
					- It's hard to love the whole human kind at that moment.

					- But with a good team, a team you trust, another thought comes to mind:
				</aside>

			<section data-background-image="media/tk-hammonds-743182-unsplash.jpg">
				<h3>People</h3>
				<h3>are</h3>
				<h3>the best</h3>
				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- "People are the best"
					- People love to shine, people love being heros, people want to do work they can be proud of.
					- Be the Alfred to your Batmans.
					- Be Jarvis to your Iron Mans.
					- Clear the road in front of them, and let them work.
					- Open the doors for you team and
					- Trust you team.

			<!-- COMMUNICATION -->

			<section data-background-image="media/pavan-trikutam-1660-unsplash.jpg">
				<h2>Communication</h2>
				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- And trust is in large part built through communication.

			<section data-background-image="media/joshua-ness-225844-unsplash.jpg">
				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- Have regular 1-on-1s
					- you can have them scheduled or not.
					- in my experience, scheduled works better,
					- it leaves time for team member to prepare.
					- If you don't schedule it, they will probably not happen.
					- Just don't do it too often or keep it running for too long.
					- And if you want to earn your team members trust, be prepared to open yourself too.
					- These 1-on-1s work both ways.
					- Be honest there.
					- Prepare to be vulnerable.
					- Let you guard down and show your true face.
					- After all, that is what you are hoping to get from your team too.
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section data-background-image="media/helena-lopes-592971-unsplash.jpg">
				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- With group meetings,
					- Learn how to lead and moderate them.
					- Know who should be in a meeting and who gains nothing from it.

					- Some time ago, I was just a regular dev in that team,
					- I was in a conference call with my wireless headphones on sitting comfortably in my home office.
					- It was a meeting that took a wrong turn somewhere and now there were 10 of us trapped listening to conversation between just 2 people.
					- First thing I did was subtly turning off the camera and went to make a fresh cup of tea.
					- Then... I started folding laundry.
					- Then I put a new load in the washing machine.
					- Then I did the dishes.
					- I also cleaned out some leftovers from the fridge.
					- Was just starting to look for the vacuum when people started to say goodbye.

					- My general rule of thumb:
					- if you are talking in a meeting for longer than 3 minutes about a topic that only concers a small part of people in the meeting, that should be a separate meeting probably.

					- Capture meeting decisions and share them afterwards as a TLDR; doc.
					- You are creating a paper trail of decisions and action items
					- and giving chance for others in team or even company to see the updates easily.
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section data-background-image="media/rawpixel-632465-unsplash.jpg">
				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- I have a nice bonus suggestion for you I've picked up from a client:
					- start a group meeting with a random question, but totally random.
					- It can span from
					- "which animal describes you today?"
					- to...
					- "what's the weirdest thing in your fridge?"
					- It's an ice breaker, somebody will always say something interesting or funny, and all of the sudden you are all talking and sharing stuff around the same topic.
					- See, out-of-box cohesion!

			<!-- PRAISE -->

			<section data-background-image="media/ariel-besagar-497034-unsplash.jpg">
				<h2>Praise</h2>
				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- As a good leader you need to recognize and magnify the accomplishments of your team mates.
					- Praise and commendations are a powerful tool that you can use to boost team mood and engagement.
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section data-background-image="media/japheth-mast-329255-unsplash.jpg">
				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- Celebrate progress.
					- That doesn't mean you should handle out silly participations trophys,
					- Use the power of compliment only when there is something tangible to compliment.
					- Don't force it.
					- It will start sounding insincere.
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section data-background-image="media/neil-rosenstech-467457-unsplash.jpg">
				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- But also don't focus on only the big accomplishments.
					- People are everyday working on problems that are not on the forefront of you product,
					- but are still important.
					- Small wins that move the product forward are the thing you are looking for here.

				<h2>Closing</h2>
				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- There are many more roles that I haven't touched today.

					- I would like for you to take home if nothing else than my final pieces of advices:
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section data-background-image="media/paul-schafer-787418-unsplash.jpg">
				<h3>Learn</h3>
				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- As with you previous dev role, you need to continue learning new skills.
					- If you got it this far, you were probably good at that, so use those old learning skills to pick up this hot potato.
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section data-background-image="media/lauren-lulu-taylor-692833-unsplash.jpg">
				<h3>Trust</h3>
				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- The same way you need to trust people, people need to trust you.
					- This takes time.
					- It won't happen over night.
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section data-background-image="media/alfred-leung-332441-unsplash.jpg">
				<h3>Protect</h3>
				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- Often you are the one that's protecting the team from "higher forces" and if you are doing a good job of making your team feel safe, you will earn team's trust.
					- So continue asking those questions people don't dare to ask.
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section data-background-image="media/rawpixel-651335-unsplash.jpg">
				<h3 class="black">Open discussions</h3>
				<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
					- Don't avoid hard conversations and decisions.
					- Be open about them with the team.
					- If you can, democratize decision making.
					- Make everybody feel included.
					- Encourage discussion.
